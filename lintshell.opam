synopsis: "A linter for POSIX shell working on concrete syntax tree"
description: """
Lintshell is a linter for POSIX shell. The main difference with other
linters for shell is that Lintshell relies on Morbig---a parser for
POSIX shell---to provide concrete syntax trees and iterators on these
syntax trees. This gives a very large expressive power to the linting
rules.
